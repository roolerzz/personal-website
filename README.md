This repository belongs to the static [website](www.sethihemant.com) hosted on netlify for the purposes of my personal portfolio and future blog posts and notes purposes. The website has been built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) a static site generator and the [Academic theme](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/).

#### Here are some raw notes I captured during the excersise I went through while building this website
