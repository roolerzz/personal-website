title: "Technical Writing & Paper Analysis"
---

I write about distributed systems, storage architecture, and AI infrastructure, combining academic research with production systems experience. My focus is on bridging theory and practice—analyzing foundational papers and emerging research while sharing insights from building large-scale systems.

## Topics

**AI Storage Systems**
- RDMA-enabled storage for GPU clusters
- Node-local caching strategies
- Multi-protocol storage (NFS/S3)
- Storage benchmarking methodologies

**Distributed Systems**
- Architecture patterns from classic papers (Dynamo, Spanner, GFS, Raft)
- Consensus algorithms and consistency models
- Performance optimization and profiling

**Production Systems**
- High-throughput data streaming (Akka Streams, reactive systems)
- Large-scale infrastructure challenges
- Real-world case studies from AWS, Crusoe, WeWork

## Writing in Progress

I'm currently working on deep-dive analyses of:
- RDMA-First Object Storage System with SmartNIC Offload
- Fire-Flyer AI-HPC infrastructure architecture
- Object storage vs. parallel file systems for LLM training
- Comprehensive notes on *Designing Data-Intensive Applications*
