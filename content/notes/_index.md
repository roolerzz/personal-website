My study notes on foundational papers in distributed systems and AI infrastructure. These capture system designs, architectural decisions, and implementation details from papers I'm working through.

**Note:** These notes are intentionally comprehensive (often 40-60% of source material) to save time when revisiting concepts. I also post condensed analysis and opinion pieces on my [Blog](/posts/).
