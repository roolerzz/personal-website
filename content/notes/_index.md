Comprehensive study notes on foundational whitepapers, and technical books in distributed systems and AI infrastructure. These are detailed, reference-grade notes capturing system designs, architectural decisions, and implementation details.

**Note:** These notes are intentionally comprehensive (often 40-60% of source material) for the purpose of not needing to re-read and deconstruct the original dense source, for me to save some time revisiting things. I will also be posting condensed analysis or opinion posts on my [Blog](/posts/).
