As an aspiring technical author and industry speaker, I'm actively pursuing publication opportunities in AI storage systems and distributed systems infrastructure. My goal is to contribute to both academic research and industry knowledge sharing in these fields.

## Research Areas

### AI Storage Optimization
- **RDMA-enabled object storage for ML workloads**: Exploring low-latency data access patterns for GPU-intensive training, with focus on RDMA integration for sub-microsecond data transfers
- **Node-local (Tier-0) caching strategies**: Investigating pre-fetching algorithms and cache eviction policies optimized for training/infernece workload patterns in frontier models.
- **Multi-protocol data access (NFS/S3)**: Analyzing consistency models and performance tradeoffs when supporting both POSIX and object storage semantics over unified datasets

### Distributed Systems Performance
- **Storage benchmarking methodologies**: Developing frameworks to profile I/O bottlenecks for NFS and Object Storage Systems as well as support PyTorch/TensorFlow data loading pipelines
- **High-throughput data streaming**: Architectural patterns for scaling ingestion and delivery platforms to billions of events per day using reactive programming models (Akka Streams)

## Potential Publication Topics

I'm preparing material for technical articles on:

- **Storage Architecture for GPU-Intensive ML Training**: Comprehensive analysis of storage bottlenecks in large-scale model training and mitigation strategies
- **Benchmarking Tools for Storage Systems**: Comprehensive analysis of benchmarking tools used across storage systems
- **Tier-0 Caching in AI Infrastructure**: Design patterns for node-local caching in distributed GPU clusters
- **Multi-Protocol Storage: Bridging HPC and Cloud-Native ML**: Technical challenges in supporting both NFS and S3 protocols

## Collaboration & Speaking

I welcome opportunities for:
- **Co-authorship** on papers related to AI infrastructure, storage systems, or distributed computing
- **Conference speaking** at systems conferences (FAST, OSDI, SoCC, etc.) or industry events
- **Technical blog posts** and industry publications
- **Peer review** and technical feedback on related work

### Academic & Industry Interests
My research draws inspiration from foundational distributed systems work (Dynamo, Spanner, GFS, Raft, Tao, Memcached) and aims to bridge academic research with real-world production challenges in AI infrastructure.
